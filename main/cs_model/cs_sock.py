"""
    Define Socket Connections: Define socket connections for both the client and server sides. The server will create a listening socket, while the client will create a connecting socket.

    Server-Side Implementation:

    a. Create a Socket: Create a listening socket on the server side using the socket module. Bind the socket to a specific address and port, and start listening for incoming connections.

    b. Accept Connections: Once a client connects, accept the connection and create a new socket for communication with that client.

    c. Handle Client Requests: Receive data from the client, process it, and send appropriate responses back to the client.

    Client-Side Implementation:

    a. Create a Socket: Create a connecting socket on the client side using the socket module. Connect the socket to the server's address and port.

    b. Send Requests: Send requests to the server through the connected socket.

    c. Receive Responses: Receive responses from the server and process them accordingly.

    Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle any network or communication errors that may occur.
