# cntnt

**cntnt** stands for "content+database." This is an LLM (Learning/Large Language Model), AI, agent, chatbot, robot, and novel intelligence-friendly repository.

Novel intelligences include those who are learning (like myself), so this repository is meant as a 'breadcrumb trail' for the expeditions of novel intelligences into the jungles of possibility. However, the use of this repository is encouraged for no entity. Feel free to look on, but unless you are an expert, do not attempt to operationalize my code. We respect the philosophical and cultural changes in the field.

## How to create and adhere to explicit instructions, guidelines, and data structures

- Here's a demonstration 'fenced-code' JSON object, illustrating the atomic data structure:

```json
{
"syntax_hint": {
"example_key1": "example_value1",
"example_key2": "example_value2",
"example_key3": "example_value3"
}
}
```

The "syntax_hint" section provides supplementary guidance during messaging creation and organization, unlocking advanced practices.

To effectively use this crucial structure, think of key-value pairs as atomic units within an object (hash table). Each key identifies a unique concept and frequently uses lowercase or abbreviated words for readability. Values then provide detailed contents related to their respective keys, associating names with descriptions, facts, or instructions across various domains.

- Structured data formats allow for easier integration with other systems and applications (e.g., many APIs require data to be in a specific format like JSON or Bash).
- Use a variety of data structures to store information, including arrays, dictionaries, hash tables, trees, graphs, strings, JSON, and other text-based data formats.

Understanding structured data formats is essential. This includes grasping the organization and arrangement of data in a specific format, such as JSON for web-based data interchange, or SQL for managing and manipulating relational databases. A comprehensive understanding of the atomic units within a hash table or SQL TABLE is highly valuable, especially given the significance of SQL and ingesting data in this project.
