The server class would be responsible for managing the knowledge graph data and providing access to the client. It would handle the following tasks:

    Knowledge Graph Management: Maintain and update the knowledge graph data, ensuring its consistency and accuracy.

    Data Access: Respond to client requests for knowledge graph data, providing efficient retrieval and filtering mechanisms.

    Data Security: Implement appropriate security measures to protect the knowledge graph data from unauthorized access.

    Scalability: Ensure the server can handle increasing load and data volumes by utilizing appropriate scaling techniques.

    Asynchronous Processing: Implement asynchronous methods to handle concurrent client requests and improve performance.

"""
The analogy of the commander-in-chief, generals, and battalions aptly describes the hierarchical structure and asynchronous nature of a system with multiple REST API endpoints representing asynchronous functions.

At the highest level, the commander-in-chief (client) issues a decree (request), which is the overarching goal. The generals (middleware) break down this larger goal into campaigns (tasks) and assign them to specific battalions (asynchronous functions).

Each battalion, operating independently and asynchronously, executes its assigned task, handling the complexities and uncertainties of the battlefield (data processing, decision-making, etc.). While the commander-in-chief remains unaware of the intricate details of each battalion's actions, they receive updates (responses) and maintain overall control of the operation.

This hierarchical and asynchronous structure offers several advantages:

    Scalability: The system can handle large workloads by distributing tasks across multiple battalions (functions).

    Flexibility: New tasks or changes to existing tasks can be implemented by modifying the orders (request parameters) and the battalions' (functions') behavior.

    Fault Tolerance: If a battalion (function) encounters an error, other battalions can continue operating, ensuring overall system resilience.

    Abstraction: The commander-in-chief (client) is shielded from the complexities of each battalion's (function's) operations, simplifying interaction and reducing the risk of errors.
